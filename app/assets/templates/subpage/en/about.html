<p>Empowering high-school youth one special English language class at a time.</p>
 
<p>CFBE is a project funded by a United States Department of State grant and managed by The Kings Foundation, a NGO helping Polish students apply to top universities abroad. CFBE will reach pupils from rural and urban areas of Poland. It is designed to empower high-school youth during English language classes. We achieve it through: </p>
<ul>
<li>providing access to knowledge about higher education programmes, application system in the US,</li>
<li>discussing future opportunities.</li>
</ul>
 
<p>CFBE team specially designed a module that teachers will implement within high-school English language curriculum. Through this they will equip their students with knowledge about higher education opportunities abroad. This should broaden studentsâ€™ academic prospects and encourage them to rise up to their full potential. </p>
